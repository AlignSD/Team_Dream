## Description

My homework project for the week was to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.

Step 1: Clone/Fork repo
